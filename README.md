# NFT Game Project - Inuyasha World Slayer ⚔️

### 🚨 _This project is on the Rinkeby tesnet      !! **Make sure that is the network you are connected to** !!_

### Welcome 👋
As a part of my web3 developer adventures I wanted to expand my knowledge of NFT's so I decided to build an game 
using NFT's! 

This project outline has been put together by [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) a great place for developers to learn more
about web3 🌈 🛠

### Project Details
This project has been built using:

- hardhat & ethers.js
- React (create-react-app)

_Note: I have another repo called 'nft-game-contract' which is the smart contract this project is using... check it out [here](https://github.com/UnionPAC/nft-game-contract)_


### How it works 💮
1. Connect using your MetaMask wallet
2. Select a character to play as - this character you select is actually an NFT which will be minted and given to you!
3. Use your new NFT character to help bring the Boss down to 0 Health Points
